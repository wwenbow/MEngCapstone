Abstract 
 

The developed control methodology can be used to build more efficient intelligent and precision 
mechatronic systems. Three degrees of freedom robot arm is controlled by adaptive sliding mode fuzzy 
algorithm fuzzy sliding mode controller (SMFAFSMC). This plant has 3 revolute joints allowing the 
corresponding links to move horizontally. Control of robotic manipulator is very important in field of robotic, 
because robotic manipulators are Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO), nonlinear and most of dynamic 
parameters are uncertainty. Design strong mathematical tools used in new control methodologies to 
design adaptive nonlinear robust controller with acceptable performance in this controller is the main 
challenge. Sliding mode methodology is a nonlinear robust controller which can be used in uncertainty 
nonlinear systems, but pure sliding mode controller has chattering phenomenon and nonlinear equivalent 
part in uncertain system therefore the first step is focused on eliminate the chattering and in second step 
controller is improved with regard to uncertainties. Sliding function is one of the most important challenging 
in artificial sliding mode algorithm which this problem in order to solved by on-line tuning method. This 
paper focuses on adjusting the sliding surface slope in fuzzy sliding mode controller by sliding mode fuzzy 
algorithm.
